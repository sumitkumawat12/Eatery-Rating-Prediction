While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and coffee. Upon entering the McDonald's the floors were extremely dirty, but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch rush. Then when I stepped up to the counter to order, the menu screens were stuck on frozen 2 advertisements. Then I order 2 Caramel Mocha  Coffees. After about 3min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the manager. Come to find out the machine is on auto-clean and it will be 18min before our coffee is ready. Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular coffees. When I tell them that regular coffee is 1$ a cup and I was charged 7.58$ for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in food. That's nice and all, but we did not want nor need any food. I ask for just a refund at that point. Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the 18min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of there. The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly trained. While they were nice and tried to make it right, I think better training of the employees at this location is necessary. While waiting for my refund I watched multiple other customers receive the wrong order or had issues with their food. I dont often go to McDonald's but continued visits with poor service has definitely left a bad impression!"

It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits, I mean really sour.
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries.
When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke... It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids!!
Will not ever return."

I think  MacDonald's head quarters should go and check up on this place specially on give a  training to employees and managers in how to  give an excellent service. But this is not a plasent place to have a Burger..

But they didn't cook my quarter pounder to temp because it was still red on the inside of the meat which was disgusting. I had to go to the door in order to get my burger fixed which then I ran into the situation of them starting to close their doors 5 minutes before they were supposed to close at 12 and the employee looked at me and said we are closed when I literally was holding the burger in my hand to show for proof. I look at the employee and say I know I came up here because I had just ordered from the drive thru this burger and it isn't cooked all the way. She takes the burger doesn't say anything and shuts the door with me standing outside. I then wait thank gosh she came back with a new one I didn't know if she was going to. I didn't get an apology though for my burger not being cooked all the way through though.

I agree these are smaller items and do not effect the price much, however, when you have kids waiting for their orders get very upset and get angry n hurt that these things are missing.  It is very upsetting!  Also, we tend to order a lot of unsweetened ice teas.  8 out of 10 times the tea tastes disgusting!!  It is old tea or the bag doesn't get changed when the make more.  I get so mad that no one seems to care enough to be sure every shift cares to do their job correctly to ensure a high quality in ALL their products.  I have brought these concerns to numerous managers and employees but never get satisfaction that they care and fix the issue!!  It may be ok for a week but happens again or on a different shift.  All emplyees should care enough about their jobs and themselves to do the best they can in all areas of a job performance!!!

I went to the drive thru and only ordered 2 hamburgers and a small fry. I paid and pulled up to get my food and was given the wrong order. I let the associate know it wasn't correct. He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food. As I sat and waited time was just ticking by. After 15 minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food. No one came back. I knocked on the glass and no response. As about the 10th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed. I asked where my food was and he said he was making it. I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of 28 minutes after first paying. I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened. I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time 28 minutes later. He said oh I'm sorry they're new. Terrible customer service and uncaring management.

My husband checks online to make sure the restaurant and dining room are open. They are. He walks over and the doors are locked. Walks back to the hotel, takes his car through the drive through, sits for 10 minutes and receives no service although there were employees in the restaurant. He sees other cars trying to receive service but they are all being ignored. He comes back to the hotel and calls again, at least 6 times, each time it says the number is disconnected even though he had already confirmed they were open through the same number earlier. Finally someone answers the call, he asks if they are open and they said no, he asked them why they answered the phone and were in the restaurant at 1am if it is closed, they said because their job is just to answer the phone. Its clear that the employees wanted to get paid for working all night without serving any customers. My husband used to work in fast food, and I wanted to believe that the stereotypes of McDonalds employees being terrible people and workers to not be true, but this location makes the company look bad. McDonald's should fire the franchise owner, or shut this location down, because they clearly dont know how to hire dependable employees."

Where is the quality????? They don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it.

I was asked to wait at drive thru. No other customers were in queue. They forgot about me. The order was reduced without telling me. The apple pies were removed without any explanation. When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn't identify herself. She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn't provide it. Bad experience with the food too. The fries were so over salted I couldn't eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen. End to end bad experience.

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff. I waited at the drive thru order kiosk, then at the payment window and then at the pick up window. Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me. I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too. When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order. I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait. Her response was I just put on the headset. Seriously that was her response. There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service. Why didn't she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person. I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness. NOT LOVING IT.

They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under 20 min.

Tonight,  there was no line. Also the inside was closed. AND...  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKEN/SHUT OFF. SHOCKER.

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat. So thats why we went.

Then they didn't put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off. 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot.
So... I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag. She said No, we can't do that.
REALLY!?!?!?! I have worked in the food industry for 28 years.  I am well aware of what you can and can not do.
You didn't WANT TO. You didn't want to value me as a person, a customer,  or a future. You didn't want to do your job properly in the 1st place. You didn't want to apologize in any way shape or form.

I don't mind that a mistake was made. I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with.

Well, my normal favorite is the quarter pounder with cheese .... today it was that Spain inspired burger. I guess it was the cheese or the sauce(normally I don't like sauces on my burger) but I don't know if it was the combination of bacon, the different cheeses or what, but it was soooo good. Yum I will have to come back to this McDonalds. I don't think they sell this burger in just any McDonalds, I think it has to be in one of the safari themed ones. Anyway it was really good!

I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly.

She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window. A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries, cold nuggets, no toy, no sauce, no napkins. When I showed the kid's meal, he said what happened to the fries? (as if we ate them). I looked at him and said ""that's what you guys gave me and to look at the camera"". He then said ""hold on"" and slammed the window. Another 5 mins go by, gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag, but it wasn't there. As he was getting me the sauce, I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review. He shrugged his shoulders, slammed the window and left. I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window, but he never did.
I'm a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members. My 6 year old grand-daughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation.

When I got to the window I clarified again, but was told they didn't have that in their system, and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble. I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didn't have what I ordered. I told him to go out and check his menu, because it was on there. He told me he didn't need to, that it was not on the menu. He was very rude and dismissive. I realize it is just a few cents difference, but why should anyone pay for something they didn't order, especially if what you ordered is on the menu. I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally, and rudely. I don't recommend visiting this McDonalds, luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect."

They don't pay enough, so the employee turnover rate is high or they just don't show up, they have seemingly no limits on how many delivery and mobile orders people can place so they get backlogged, swamped, and can't keep up.

I parked, called, told them I had an order and they said to get in the drive thru. By the time I got to the window; they hadn't even started the order. It took 20 minutes in total. I lost money waiting on McDonald's.

Seriously, reformat your business structure. It was embarrassing working here and apologizing for the ineptitude of this company.

Be nice to the employees, it's not their fault. I'm not even sure it's the manager's fault, but they have to tell their higher ups about this."

I do and find that this burger is pink as well, so now this is 2 pink burgers in total given to me. I tell them, they go ahead and apologize and gives me another... And yes, you guessed it, a third pink burger!!!!!! So at this point of course I am very much disgusted and appalled by their lack attentiveness of the food they are distributing to the point I ask another customer next to me if he had seen what I did....

They have a fish tank here overcrowded with African cichlids, an aggressive type of fish who will chase each other around, nip at each other and other fish, and sometimes even kill them. They have one Bala shark, which is a very peaceful schooling fish who should be in a group of at LEAST 4 other Bala sharks. (Schooling fish can die from stress in some cases if they are alone.)  He is being nipped at, his fins are torn, and he gets about 16 inches long full grown. There are Plecos that also get about 24 inches long full grown in there too.

The customer service is highly lacking and I'm positive the management of that location is damaging your brand. Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible. We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response. We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited. Zero response. We spoke multiple times. No reaponse. No one greeted us. No one asked us to wait. Nothing. Radio silence. Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder. Needless to say we drove away without making an order. It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonald's.

And after the second time through I got home to that trash sandwich and they also forgot the sauce for the nuggets, even through I saw it on my receipt so they knew I wanted it, and hot cakes without butter. Just carelessness on all fronts at this location. Oh and when I got to the pick-up window I told the woman I have a boy so please put a boy toy in the happy meal, and she said all of our toys are unisex. I will include a picture of his ""unisex"" toy. Take the time and drive pass to the next McDonalds along your route."

This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks, but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly. At that time, it was worth it. The menu was cheap (or at least what you know to expect from a international chain) and, since it's a chain, you know what the food is gong to be like.
So, let's look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants. You need to set yourself apart with your service. This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant. Sadly, I don't think they care anymore. The last time we went, half of the kiosks weren't working. One of the three that was, didn't print receipts. (This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious. Actually there was a lot that played into it.) Now, if you've gone to McDonald's at all recently, you know you pick your food at the kiosk, get a number that you take to your table, pay at the kiosk, sit down and wait for your food. Typically all of that takes about five minutes. Well, this day (and what I've garnered from tourists and locals, on many other days) the team at work decided they weren't going to bring the food to the table. That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE, but of course that would have been a form of service so that didn't happen. After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together (only a slight exaggeration) we were told by other customers that were leaving that they weren't calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters.
Ok... So I go up to the counter and wait. We get our food 40 minutes later, and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected. No big deal, we are used to this.
My in-laws are visiting and at this point I'm trying to figure why they haven't received their order. It dawned on me  that my father in-law doesn't have a receipt (remember the machine that wasn't printing receipts?).
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt, not the tent number. Apparently, my in-laws food was ready in a master of minutes (amazing since that is all customized) and placed in the ""abandoned order"" area. If we hadn't said anything, they would never have received their food. The lady never once called a tent number. We told another person of the lack of receipt problem. That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers. When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt, she asked us what the receipt number was. We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine, and she asked again for the receipt.
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do, the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump. I'm not sure if they just didn't staff well on this shift, but like I said, I've talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while."

There were others on line waiting to take their order and I feel like she deliberately embarrassed me. There was no need to make me feel degraded, at the end of the day I am a customer and I have no need to bring my business here.

They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drive-thru, but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds: The management.

The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drive-thru timer, because you will always have to pull up at this McD's. Always. Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times (1 burger + fry at 3pm = pull up next to the 3-4 other cars already there).

The one manager I've had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well. I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order (that I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes for, no less) and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card. The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash. The best part? He made me pull up to get the cash.

So again: Mis-managed, terrible McDonalds. It's a franchise for a reason, this one just stinks."

Cashier was new and a bit rude. We ordered three meals. She rang everything up separate but left off our hash browns. Manager made us pay to get our hash browns. Forget that it was all way more expensive cause of how she rang it up to begin with...then the cashier kept telling the manager in front of us that we never said we wanted meals, even though when I repeatedly told her we wanted meals she kept saying ""sure I can make that a meal for you.""

I liked the food a lot. I had heard of the location having pizza and pasta so I got both. I also got a large fries a burger and drinks. Me and my party enjoyed the food and honestly the pizza was in some ways better than other pizza places.

Only con:
I'd recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing fast. Not sure if this is a regular issue but seems like when I have gone it's like this."

Really love the clean store, the big mac is delicious and so are the breakfast items and chicken nuggets. The convention is right here so there are a lot of tourists but they have a self serve kiosk that helps to speed up taking orders. Highly recommend this store if you're in the area. The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat. Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive (the road) is pretty interesting at times. In conclusion, I rate this McDonald's 5/5 and I hope to be back soon to take out more food to do mukbangs."

We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register. We waited over 20 minutes for 3 standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant. The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders. While waiting, we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it. At that point, I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didn't realize it hadn't been served. We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something, whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for. The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything.

I was asked to wait at drive thru. No other customers were in queue. They forgot about me. The order was reduced without telling me. The apple pies were removed without any explanation. When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didn't identify herself. She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldn't provide it. Bad experience with the food too. The fries were so over salted I couldn't eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen. End to end bad experience.

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff. I waited at the drive thru order kiosk, then at the payment window and then at the pick up window. Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me. I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too. When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order. I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait. Her response was I just put on the headset. Seriously that was her response. There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service. Why didn't she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person. I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness. NOT LOVING IT.

Visited again on 3/17/2018 and had the same experience. Even the white shirt manager ignored me."

It didn't look like much from the outside, but once I entered I walked up to the counter to order one coffee which took a few minutes since the place was somewhat busy and there was a customer in line in front of me.

I got my order and walked upstairs to the first level and sat at a comfortable booth. Within a few minutes a manager came to my table to ask if everything was OK, and I told him ""Yes"", but I was having trouble to connect to the free WiFi. He immediately helped me with this and although the connection was slow, I was pleased that the problem was solved.

Then the manager chatted with me and asked if I would mind doing a survey and I filled out the online survey. Then he said I was entitled to a free burger so I had a Big Mac.

I think this is a very well managed place and will definitely return when I am back in Manhattan in the Chinatown area."

There's no reason to give these service workers a hard time they're doing what they can. Thanks guys. Everyone once in awhile I want some chicken nuggies and and it's always you guys and your sweet and sour love sauce. Hot mustard is acceptable sometimes.

And all the while I watch at least 12 other cars pull up to drive thru sit and wait and eventually leave cause nobody is taking orders.

The Food.
We tried pizza and, surprisingly, it was pretty good having in mind it came from the fast food chain. Touch screen menu had enough options of ingredients to customize pizza order based on personal taste. Keep in mind that some toppings cost extra. I would rate pizza 7-8 points out of 10.

Buns are harder than a rock. I got a fish fillet and had to throw it in the garbage. I got a biscuit sandwich earlier and the bread was too hard. I had to throw it out.

I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was 17 so I know a thing or two about the process and how it's really not rocket science but somehow they can't ever get it right. Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didn't specify which one to go to... although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it, and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know. Tonight it was missing fries (we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch) and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while... stone cold fries? I wouldn't put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though. And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which I'm sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it... which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it. I would be embarrassed to own this place. Don't go here... I know it's fast food and we shouldn't expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints. Trust me it's worth the drive."

Not only did their security guard get rude with me they didnt even have the professionalism to let me know it's against rules to charge phone to make an order. Only was charging to phone to make order thru app. Then after getting kicked out they wouldn't give me a refund or my food, said to call number.

Me being black I deal with this a lot. But I hope reviews like this can help wake people up and hold people accountable for discriminatory behavior.

There isn't really a lot of friendly interaction between the clerk and the guest as well. For the most part this is what I gathered from this place.

Having worked for mcdonalds in the past, I know for a FACT it takes just a little over 2 minutes to fry a full basket of fries (which leads 3 large fries).

1. Kiosks are backed up with a bunch of people each so no where to stand, wait, or snake through with trays of food. Kiosks were glitchy and blanked out every minute.
2. It is at least 10 degrees warmer upstairs so NOT comfortable at all.
3. Even with our order number on the table no one ever brought food...after 20 minutes, i went down stairs and it was sitting there. Then there is no drink station upstairs so with an already full tray, i had to bring food up and then come down for drinks. So why did i have to pick a flavor if the only deliver an empty?
4. No one to help with service or questions. Lady upstairs spoke no English. I had to raise my hand at the counter after standing there 5 minutes to find my food just to get acknowledged.
5. After all that, found one sandwich missing. Went back again and notified i was missing the cheese steak and staff member walked to the other pasta section where it was sitting by itself.
6. Cheeseburgers were not made to order as requested on the kiosk.
7. Big mac was dry. Worst one ever.

We won't be back."

The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat. Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive (the road) is pretty interesting at times.

It cannot be spelled out any clearer. ""Quarter pounder. Absolutely nothing on it. No cheese. Just the meat and the bun."" It is so simple. Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right. But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line, so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous.

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order. Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it. The stale, burned bun breaks (picture). I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find there's another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well.

I stopped into the location on Rt73 in west Berlin NJ  for lunch today. The drive through line was super long so I parked and went I side. I ordered a number 5 (artisan chicken sandwich) meal. I paid, waited like 15 minutes, they called my number and I brought my ticket to the counter and took my bag. I got to work and found out I didn't get a chicken sandwich but instead I got a big mac. Which normally wouldn't be an issue but I hate big macs, I've gotten sick eating one before and ever since I can't even look at a big mac without getting sick to my stomach. Needless to say I wasn't happy. I threw the bag in my car and went on with the rest of my work day... on the way home I stopped back in and brought the bag of food back to McDonald's. The manager named Rebecca came to the counter and I told her what happened and I showed her all of the food I got and explained to her what I was supposed to get.(keep in mind I didn't even touch a fry) She was super rude to me and said she can't do anything because I didn't save my receipt. I don't know about anyone else but I always hand my ticket in when they call my number to prove that it's my food they're handing out. And I asked her what's the difference between a receipt and the untouched food that I brought back? I asked for a refund because I was no longer hungry, she said no, I asked for a new meal, after 5 minutes of her spouting off why she couldn't make it right, she finally gave in and walked away from me huffing and puffing and yelled to the back ""make an artisan chicken sandwich"" so a couple minutes later someone put a bag with just the sandwich in it on the counter and I asked where the fries were and she said, ""there was nothing wrong with the fries earlier, just the sandwich"" so this miserable poop butt of a manager refused to give me fresh French fries with my sandwich and handed me back the old fries from 6 hours ago. She took this whole interaction so personal and was acting like the money was coming out of her pocket. My final argument was asking her if she thought I was lying and did she think I made the big mac and fries at my house and brought it in to pull one over on her? What a horrible experience. It sucks when you get 30 minutes for lunch and you're starving and wind up not being able to eat and it's someone else's fault. You want someone to make it right. Instead this manager who gets to use her little bit of power to make up her own rules and make it difficult for you. Like it would of ruined her entire life to fix their error and make it right. It just sucked, I'll NEVER go back there just because of her. And I hope no one else will either. That's how pissed if this whole mess made me..."

What's that a consolation prize for losing the Big Mac."

We drove by this McDonald's and talked about how it was probably one of the biggest McDonald's in the world. After googling it it was! So we had to stop in!

It was definitely a cool experience. They offer More options than just the traditional McDonald's. We did build our own pasta and the pasta was excellent!

They also offer pizzas and different pastry options. Like cheesecake, cake, ice cream specialties.

This is a two-level McDonald's but looks to be four stories.

The first floor is the dining and kitchen. Second floor is a large play place that's two storage tall and they also have a arcade where you can earn points towards toy prizes. Kind of like Chuck e cheese..

We spent a few hours here It's spent around $30 for four of us. So it wasn't that bad.

Definitely cool to say you into the biggest McDonald's in the world!"

There was an older lady with red hair giving out deliveries of food so I was wondering when my order was going to come out waiting there for 30minutes or Longer. So I walked inside asking for my order and come to find out that my order was given to someone else! So they had to put my order again through the system so I can get my food so again Now I had to wait for others to come out before mine because my order was last in line.

Dining room was small, seemed clean (my order was to-go so didn't spend much time inside).

Loved the digital menu/self-order kiosks (ordered at the kiosk and it still gave the option to pay cash at the register, though not sure if that option's still available and/or if the dining room's even open right now...?).

Staff was friendly enough and very helpful, packed my to-go order like absolute pros.

The area where the fountain drinks, straws, etc., are wasn't super tidy (a bit of a spill on the countertop, if memory serves); however, seemed clean, otherwise.

Because it was such a quick trip, didn't get to see the condition of the bathrooms (a good indicator of an establishment's working and overall conditions, in my experience). Maybe another time?

Overall, a good experience.

Something to consider: there's no drive-through nor a parking lot and finding a parking space seems to be a nightmare/hit-or-miss in that area. Circled the surrounding blocks a few times before someone parked almost right in front of the store just happened to be leaving (not sure how often that happens, though). Score!

The previous parking spot I'd found was about 2 blocks away (doable), but kept searching in order to be closer to the other establishment my group and I were visiting prior to McD's."

I was happy there was an option for 24-hr food in case I wanted something on the way home from a night out with friends or just late-night munchies.  During the day, it's a pretty average McD's.  But they lost my business forever when I went by one night at 1am, pulled up to the order box, waited for five minutes, then finally someone came over the speaker and said ""Sorry we're closed"".

Closed?!  It's 24-hrs!  And I get it, sometimes 24-hr places will close one night every several months to do a deep cleaning.  I get that, I really do.  But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so you're not blind-sided by it.  Not this place.  I really don't think they were closed.  I think the workers were too lazy to do their job and decided to shut the store down so they could get paid to do nothing.

Additionally, this store has a bad habit of having a ""broken"" ice cream machine past 10pm.  It's always ""sorry, ice cream machine is broken"" if you come in after the lobby closes.

The worst part is I complained on the website.  I submitted a complaint for this store, pointing out the 24-hr and the ice cream issue.  All I got back (weeks later) was ""oh, sorry the ice cream machine was broken, we're working to upgrade all our locations but it takes time""  Not even a single MENTION of the ""closed"" 24-hr location.

As I said, it's a pretty standard McD's... which is synonymous with lazy, but this one takes the cake on it."

Well, tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it.
First, I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w/ Cheese, Tea for the drink, make the combo a large. So, the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen. I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink, and he tells me that I ordered it wrong. I said, ""Well, normally when I come here, they default to sweet tea."" I said that because they usually do  He said, ""Nah! That's not how we do it. Then, he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese.

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese, sweet tea, and make the combo a large. I saw that it was not right on the screen, but he repeated the order to me correctly.  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me. I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double. The person at the window talked to the person who took my order, and he came to the window and yelled, ""I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED."" I told him that I said ""double"" several times when I ordered, 5 times to be exact. He person who took my order, who looked to be a manager, yelled at me, ""NO! IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT. YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE.""

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea. He finally told me that he would make it order, but I did not trust him at this point, so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back.

This was an awful experience and I will not be back. I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years."

First 2 out of my last 3 breakfast orders were wrong. But didn't realize until I got to work. I cannot leave my job to go back.
Then today I got a steak, egg, and cheese bagel. Which was right with the exception of 2 long black hairs in it.
I stopped back on my way home and asked for a manager.
The first manager only asked for a receipt. She then left and got another manager. She was a heavy set black woman. She was the most ignorant, vile person that I've ever dealt with. Not even an apology. Her response was to bring it back? 5 hours later? When I said that was ridiculous, she closed the window and walked away. I asked for a corporate phone number and she refused.
I called and I can only assume it was the same ignorant woman because she put the phone down and left it off the hook.
I called again for the phone number and she said its on my receipt and hung up.
She is clearly incompetent and doesn't deserve her jib.
Funny thing is I didn't ask for anything free! An I'm sorry may have been enough.
But nothing even close. I would never recommend this dump of a McDonald's nor the clearly racist manager.

He went to the counter to get it and they didn't believe him at first. My coffee had the label on it for what I'd ordered but it didn't have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it, took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds. The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid. I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered.

A couple of years ago they modified the interior- they removed a lot of seats on the main floor in order to install electronic order kiosks.  There are now only a handful of places to sit in a ridiculously cramped manner.  Late at night they close the upstairs- leaving pretty much nowhere decent to sit and eat.  Tonight I saw two people eating over the garbage cans and one eating by the soda dispenser.

The kiosks are annoying.  They ask if you want to take out or eat there.  If you select ""Eat In"", before you can pay for your order you're asked to get a table marker and enter the marker number.  Thing is there are absolutely no table markers- you cannot complete your order without one- unless you start over and select ""take out"".

During the day perhaps eating in makes sense- but late at night it's really only for take out."

There are 3 total signs displaying this premise, but 2 are on the opposite side of the lot and one is not reflective for their 7-10 night shift of booting/towing.  The signs also say people who aren't patrons will be booted, which I by extension was. My night was spent arguing with the employees and the tow company instead.  I recommend a wholehearted boycott."

Many of the self-ordering machines do not work, when you use a normal line with a cashier, it's like the employees have never even been to a McDonald's before as they don't even know the menu items (I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal, so it wasn't pasta, or some sandwich that only special locations have).  When you order at a kiosk, you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream.  Then you wait 15+ minutes to find out they don't have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one, which she doesn't know how to do so you end up paying $4+ for a cup of ice cream.  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldn't believe it took that long.

With that said, the fact that they force you to utilize the kiosk must me some kind of self sabotage. If people are willing to pay at the counter then it could drive down demand for the kiosk.

Secondly; there is a heavyset woman with glasses that gets mad and angry when customers ask for stuff and has to forward it to the manager every time yelling loud enough for rhe lobby; not to mention she hovers over the lobby while people are eating (i get that you want to catch mess early or clean the tables quick I have worked food service before) but do not hover around people trying to eat like some kind of table patrol.

Fortunately the security guard is calm and collected. I mean generally if youre on the clock where else do you have to be?

Where is the quality????? They don't care if people are upset and/or get food poisoning?? Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving, but he didn't think to (not surprised). I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries, but an extra sandwich, but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrong..meat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it.

They have a sauce they're advertising on a poster at the drive through that says ""Honey"" sauce, but when you get to the window, no one knows what you're talking about.
Anyhow, the most recent experience was a great example of poor customer service and why we won't be returning to this location.
Waiting at the drive thru for almost half an hour like usual, the manager comes to the window where they give you your food and says that our (my husband and I's) nuggets aren't done yet and requests us to park nearby to wait. That's fine, as we do so without complaint. The manager comes out 5-10 minutes later to give us our food. We take it and get home to find that the bottom box in the bag was some nasty ass Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich, and not 20piece nuggets. That's not what we paid for or ordered. We go back to this McDonalds another day and ask for the manager; his employees had to yell for him and almost convince him to come up to the window, as I heard them yelling to him, ""They want to talk to you!"" countless times, as if he asked out of frustration and anger. After he was torn away from the slow work he wasn't helping with while in his office, he pretended he didn't understand what I said and said he couldn't write anything or give me a coupon for anything since he didn't have some kind of coupon book? I asked him if he could give us  what we bought next time since we had already paid. He said yes and we left. Yesterday was the last day we visited this location; and we asked for the manager at the first pay window. He acted like he had no idea who we were after that whole ordeal and gave us HALF off our 20 piece nuggets that we were buying! He lied to our faces after he said he would take care of it! You would think how much revenue, McDonalds brings in, the manager wouldn't be so stingy and would apologize and provide what's necessary to remediate the situation! He acted so snide and unapologetic too. Needless to say, experiencing slow service, disrespect and a poor account of responsibilities; we won't be returning."

This McDonaldýýýs located at 262 Canal Street, in Chinatown, New York City have been here for ages.

All McDonaldýýýs are created equal in terms of cleanliness, so it is no surprise that it is very clean, neat, tidy and spotlessly clean.

It is a huge McDonaldýýýs because it has 3 stories, but on the second and third floor, there is a limited number of chairs.  Poor design left it with about 40 to 50 seats on the 2 top floors.

The staff is very professional, friendly and polite with a smile, and there are staff who are bilingual {English and Chinese) (English and Spanish).

Enjoy  Mickey Dýýýs  and

A Happy Thanksgiving."

The chicken sandwich was not hot either  and worse , it was waaaay overly smeared  with unhealthy  mayo which  I threw away so as to not suffer food poisoning. It was by far the worst fast food restaurant experience ever in my life and it cost me a whopping  9 dollars and 93 cents. I WANT A REFUND PLEASE.

I expected a 30 foot statue of Ronald McDonald and it ended up being a lackluster 30 foot lighted outline of Ronald on the building.  The picture online of the building made it look like it was made of a French Fry building structure.  It wasn't.  They had a separate drink station where you gave them your drink order (an extra step because no self service ones anywhere).  They had a separate dessert station, and a walk up food counter to order or self-serve kiosks to order from, where they will serve if you eat in (but not the soft drinks).  It is 2 stories.  The 2nd floor is a play area which I expected would be huge (it isn't), and a small arcade area...very small.  The menu showed some items different from other McDonald's but 95% of them showed OUT OF STOCK. So we just ate the kind of food you could eat at a regular McDonald's only it cost MUCH more!

I usually never have an issue when I go to other McDonald's. I order the same thing. Well its not fresh, its called ""to order"". I had to wait , no issues with that, if you want fresh food you typically have to wait for it to be made.  I got my food 8 minutes later and drove off so I could get the food to the house. Almost home, I look in the bag and grab a fry, because mcdonalds fries fresh are freaking delicious. Yeah no, I bit 5 fries all at once and they were soggy and unsalted. Highly disappointed. I tried to call and the phone just rang. I was no longer close to the mcdonalds so I just ordered the same thing at another mcdonalds closer to my destination in winter park. They actually gave me a discount and apologized for my troubles at this mcdonalds. They said they ""understood"". I wont be coming back to this mcdonalds."

Waited 30 minutes for my first (and very probably last) spicy chicken sandwich (photo attached). You'd think with taking that amout of time it would at least resemble the menu picture in some small way, but no.
They ALMOST managed to get some sauce in there. Slightly more would have helped disguise the taste of the burnt brioche bun! I ate it for 3 reasons 1) I was hungry 2) I didn't want to wait a further 30 minutes to be served up another sad, burnt offering and 3) the dead eyes of the staff threatened to haunt my dreams for all eternity and I just couldn't face the soulsucking experience of trying to explain my disappointment to them when they were all clearly in their own personal hells.
Take my advice, if you decide to run the gauntlet of a late evening visit to this restaurant, order the pasta, not a burger, it's pretty decent if you have at least 30 minutes to wait for it. Otherwise, do yourself a favour and wander on to one of the many other restaurant choices in this part of iDrive. Wish I had!"

We waited for a good 20 min and then I just asked a very nice and polite servant if I did everything correctly and when we will be served. He said all is ok and they just have too many orders at this time but he said I will help.
Suggestion to the higher management.
All orders numbers have to be on one of the displays otherwise there are no feedback to the paid clients and with a less passionate clients you may have issues.
What is for sure is that this situation decreases efficiency of the floor workers since the current state of kiosk order processing creates a situation in which ppl will be asking questions that can easily be fixed by software upgrade!!

They used to have blacks there too. Now all hispanic and trey just remodeled. All of sudden after the remodel all the staff all like the same race. I though McDonald's was equal opportunity employer. Guess not. Today I went there to use the restroom. I was told I couldn't use the restroom unless I bought something. I explained that it was an emergency and I just have to take a number one and I will be on my way. I asked to speak to the manager, the manager told me the same thing you have to buy something. I told the manager I really had to use the restroom it was an emergency I'll be in and out that's all I need it and I was still denied. Every time I come to this place is always something. Things to give me cold food all the time I would ask for fresh food and they would make me wait 20 to 30 minutes I would just wait while standing there looking at her. I wasn't really strong with expressing myself oh, now I express myself a little bit more. I just thought that everybody should know is this place really isn't a nice place to be I wouldn't give them a dime of my money. When did they treat people and I've always treated people is not okay if I was a business owner in a McDonald's along to me I would fire the entire staff shut the McDonald's down and start new with the whole new staff of all Races and ethnicities different religions in different ways of being themselves instead of running it like Fort Knox and no one even speaks English. Not a respectable place and I think a lot of changes need to happen. The last thing that we all need is a petition being signed to shutdown a very nasty, disrespectful, unprofessional in very unreliable restaurant in one of the most popular places in California. Let's get back together McDonald's or else I'll go to the next level and bringing all these customers that also it's like this McDonald's. We even go one more step above and bring the in all your future customers who have never been there before just to mention on how they've had experiences at McDonald's that were so exceptionally great and then compare it to the way that you treat all the customers who've walked out of McDonald's and see if they'll never come back I don't think we want this to be a topic of discussion."

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!

Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.
A lesson well learned, can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded."

They have a decent variety on their menu.  Now,  they are making their quarter pounders fresh when ordered so you may have a slight wait.  But I'm sure it won't take that long.  I ordered the fish sandwich which is just okay. I wish they'd make it bigger and not skimp on the slice of cheese. I like their $1, $2, and $3 menu. The fries were fresh but don't come close to wonderful fries served at the BK Lounge. Take notice though king, McDonald's is open 24 hours. I'd take their fries any day at 3AM vs. No fries from the closed Burger King near my house."

Past review...
New bulding... same substandard food. They must get corporate McDonald leftovers. Not sure why the fries and burgers taste awful compared to other McDs. Cold wilty fries and the hambuger pattes looked worse than most. Hoped the new building would have improved food. Got a green quarter pounder patty last visit in old building. Disappointed, do not like going to Plattsburgh if can help it. maybe try again in a year. hopefully better experience then."

Every morning we walk over to McDonald's to get bacon, egg, and cheese biscuits and hash browns. EVERY SINGLE MORNING that we've went over there, we have gotten hard, rubbery, cold, biscuits. Their hash browns are hard as well, and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up.

I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with ""better biscuits"". However, the replacement biscuits were undercooked. They were very doughy. I do not recommend this place to anyone. The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food."
